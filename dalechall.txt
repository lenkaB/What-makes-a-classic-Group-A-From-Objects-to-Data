The Dale-Chall list of 3,000 simple words

Also known as: Dale-Chall, Dale-Chall word list, Dale-Chall list of 3,000, Dale-Chall list of 3000 familiar words,

The Dale-Chall word list contains 3,000 simple, familiar words, which more of 80% of 4th grade students can understand. Thus, words not on that list are not familiar or unfamiliar, and therefore considered as difficult to understand.

The formula was created by Edgar Dale and Jeanne S. Chall and was published in 1948 in their book "A formula for predicting readability" (out of print). The list contained initially only 763 familiar, simple words and was later extended to 3,000, and then called Dale-Chall modified list. This formula is not the most popular although it has always been and is still considered more accurate than other formulas like the Flesch Reading Easescore, or the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level.
Dale-Chall Readability Formula

Also known as: Dale-Chall readability, Dale-Chall readability score,

The Dale-Chall readability formula computes a raw score, called the Reading Grade Score (RGS), which rates text on a U.S. grade-school level based on the average sentence length and the number of unfamiliar words, using the list of 3,000 words commonly known by 4th grade students.

The formula for the Reading Grade Score is:

    RGS = (0.1579 x DS) + (0.0496 x ASL) + 3.6365

where:

    RGS 	: 	Reading Grade Score
    DS 	: 	Dale Score, or % of words not on Dale-Chall list of 3,000 common words
    ASL 	: 	average sentence length (the number of words divided by the number of sentences)

    Then, use the mapping table below to convert the raw score, Reading Grade Score (RGS), to its corresponding grade level:

    Mapping Reading Grade Score (RGS) to Grade Level:

    4.9- 	1st grade
    2nd grade
    3rd grade
    4th grade 	Primary 	  5-10
    5.0 - 5.9 	5th grade
    6th grade 	10-12
    6.0 - 6.9 	7th grade
    8th grade 	Secondary 	12-14
    7.0 - 7.9 	9th grade
    10th grade 	14-16
    8.0 - 8.9 	11th grade
    12th grade 	16-18
    9.0 - 9.9 	13th grade
    15th grade 	College
    University 	18-22
    10+ 	16th grade
    and higher 	22+

The main idea behind the Dale-Chall readability formula is that, should a text be written with familiar words, it becomes easier to read and, therefore, expressed ideas are easier to understand and remember.
Dale Index

Also known as: Dale readability, Dale readability score, Dall reading level, Dale score, Dale formula, Dale readability index, or Dale readability formula.

The The Dale Index (DI) is based on the Flesch Reading Ease score.

The formula for the Dale Index is:

    DI = 11.534 - (0.053 x FRE)

where:

    FRE 	: 	Flesch Reading Ease score: % of words not on Dale-Chall list of 3,000 common words
    ASL 	: 	average sentence length (the number of words divided by the number of sentences)
